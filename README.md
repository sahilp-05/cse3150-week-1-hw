# CSE3150-homework-1

Create a namespace MathUtils in its own file with:
• int add(int a, int b) returning the sum
• int multiply(int a, int b) returning the product

Create a namespace AdvancedMath in its own file with:
• int square(int n) returning the square. This should call the MathUtils multiply.

Put declarations into header files and definitions into .cpp files.

Write a main.cpp that uses both namespaces and prints results.

Place your headers in a folder called include, and the .cpp files in a folder called src.

Put this in a repo called cse3150 week 1 hw in your GitHub.

Make sure you don’t push any executables to GitHub.

Make sure to test your code with pytest before pushing.
